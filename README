This is a simple animated maze generator and solver I initially wrote
years ago when I was learning Java.

I've revisited it over the years, adding improvements as I learn more
about Java. It was intially unversioned, then checked into Subversion,
and, without converting with git-svn, then Git. So most of its history
is lost.

Checkstyle is a partial build dependency. You should be able to build
without it, only with complaints from Ant.
